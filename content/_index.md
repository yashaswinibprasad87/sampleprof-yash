  content: "I had a very simple and happy childhood, and my only sibling, my younger
    Sister, would appear one year later after my own birth.  \n  \nLike my dad, I
    am introverted and am perfectly happy watching quality movies or using a personal
    computer during my spare time.I lived in Boston, Mass. For one year before I came
    to Los Angeles, I lived in Van Nuys, and then moved to Rowland Heights since my
    high school graduation.  \n  \nBecoming a Social Worker/full-time ministry has
    become my plan, especially when I like working with special needs Kids. I planned
    in working in the field of Education as a Social Worker and Preach the Word of
    God.  \n  \nFinally, it wouldn't hurt to travel to amazing places, continue to
    meet wonderful people, finish my Education/graduate school and eventually meet
    the young woman that the Lord has intended for me.  \n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------
